Welcome to Apex! Apex is a web application designed for fantasy Formula 1 enthusiasts. It allows users to create leagues with friends and compete in 1v1 challenges by composing their own team of 5 Formula 1 drivers. The points scored by these drivers in real race weeks will reflect on the users' fantasy teams.
